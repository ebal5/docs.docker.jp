If books are your preferred learning style, check out these from Docker Architect Elton Stoneman:
* [Learn Docker in a Month of Lunches (use the code `webdoc40` for 40% off)](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-docker-in-a-month-of-lunches)

Or these written by the [Docker Captains](https://www.docker.com/community/captains). Docker Captain is a distinction that Docker awards to select members of the community that are both experts in their field and are committed to sharing their Docker knowledge with others.
