Create a support dump for specified UCP nodes.

## Usage

```
docker container run --rm \
        --name ucp \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        docker/ucp \
        support [command options] > docker-support.tgz
```

## Description

This command creates a support dump file for the specified node(s), and prints it to stdout. This includes
the ID of the UCP components running on the node. The ID matches what you see when running
the `docker info` command while using a client bundle, and is used by other commands as confirmation.
